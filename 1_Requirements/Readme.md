## Introduction
Now a days we can observe resistors in almost every electric circuit.There are different types of resistors in the market.We commonly use carbon resistors in which there is a technical difference to demonstrate the resistors.Every circuit in the world is connected in series or parallel or hybrid.To ease the process this code enables to calculate the equivalent resistance.

## Benefits
It offers a range of benefits like:-
                  1)Calculates series resistance
                  2)Calculates parallel resistance
                  3)Calculates current
                  4)Calculates resistance based on colour code
                  5)Conversion of resistance to other unit

 # SWOT Analysis
 # 4W's and 1'H
 ## Who:
     Can be used in engineering institutes.
 ## When
     During calculation of resistance in circuits/resistance value based on colour code.
 ## Where
     This tool can be used all across the world. 
 ## How
    If the resistance value is known enter it to find equivalent resistance / to know the resistance 
    enter the type of colour.
