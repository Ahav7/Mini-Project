## Introduction
Now a days we can observe resistors in almost every electric circuit.There are different types of resistors in the market.We commonly use carbon resistors in which there is a technical difference to demonstrate the resistors.Every circuit in the world is connected in series or parallel or hybrid.To ease the process this code enables to calculate the equivalent resistance.
